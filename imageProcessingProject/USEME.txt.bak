List of Commands:

Important Notations: () -> Optional Arguments | [ ] -> Variable number of arguments | @ -> Variable Argument | / -> Either/or

NOTE:
For commands with (@ImageName) and (@LayerName):
If no arguments are provided for either, program will use currently loaded image and layer (if @ImageName is a non-layered image, there may be no layer loaded).
If one argument is provided, it will be assumed to be the @ImageName and the default (loaded) layer name will be used.
If both arguments are provided, they will be used in this described order.

NOTE:
For commands with only (@ImageName): If image name is not specified, program will use currently loaded image name.



create-image @ImageName @ImageType [ @Arg0 @Arg1 ... @ArgN ]
Creates a new simple image based off of image type and then following arguments.
@ImageName must not be the name of an image that already exists
@ImageType must be one of:
"transparent": Further arguments: @Width @Height, both non-negative, non-zero Integers
"empty": Further arguments: NONE
"checkerboard": Further arguments: @TileSizeInPixels @NumberOfTiles @Color1Red @Color1Green @Color1Blue @Color2Red @Color2Green @Color2Blue, 
	All of these must be non-negative integers, Number of Tiles and TileSize must be non-zero, Number of TIles must be a perfect square
"copy": Further arguments: @NameOfImageToCopy, Must reference image that has already been created by this session of the processor
"from-image": Further arguments: @ReadFileLocation, Must be a valid file location for the image
Examples:
create-image transparent transparentImage 50 40
create-image empty useless
create-image checkerboard checkerboardImage 20 25 255 0 0 0 0 0
create-image copy checkerboardTwo checkerboardImage
create-image from-image birb birb.jpg


create-layered-image @ImageName (@FileName)/[(@Width) (@Height)]
Creates a new layered image by either reading a file from specified location, or creating a new empty one with specified width and height.
@ImageName must not be the name of an image that already exists
@FileName must reference an existing or locatable file.
@Width and @Height must be non-negative and non-zero integers
Examples:
create-layered-image newLayered 10 15

update-color (@ImageName) (@LayerName) @PixelX @PixelY @Alpha @Red @Green @Blue
Updates the color of the pixel at specified positon in specified image/layer with new colors/opacity.
@ImageName must be the name of an image that already exists
@LayerName must be the name of a layer from a layered image that already exists
@PixelX, @PixelY, @Alpha, @Red, @Green, @Blue must be non-negative values integers
Example: update-color checkerboardTwo 0 0 15 16 17 18

apply-mutator @MutatorType (@ImageName) (@LayerName) [ @Arg0 @Arg1 ... @ArgN]
Apply mutator applies color transformations/filters to simple images or layers of layered images based off mutator type, and then following arguments,
NOTE: At this moment, no mutators have further arguments.
@ImageName must be the name of an image that already exists
@LayerName must be the name of a layer from a layered image that already exists
"blur": Applies a blur filter effect.
"sharpen": Applies a sharpen filter effect.
"sepia": Applies a sepia color transformation.
"greyscale": Applies a greyscale color transformation.
Examples:
apply-mutator blur birb

apply-mutator sepia
apply-mutator greyscale

save (@ImageName) (@LayerName) @OutputType @FileName

save-layered (@ImageName) @FileName

@ImageName must be the name of an image that already exists
Example: load transparentImage

set-current-layer @LayerName
Sets the given layer as the current default for other commands.
@LayerName must be the name of a layer from the given layered image that already exists

add-layer (@ImageName) @LayerName
Adds a layer to the given layered image with the given name.
@ImageName must be the name of a LAYERED image that already exists
@LayerName must not be the name of an existing layer from the given layered image
Example: add-layer newLayered emptyLayer

copy-layer (@ImageName) @LayerName @LayerToCopy
Adds a new layer to the given layered image that is a copy of the layer that has name @LayerToCopy
@ImageName must be the name of a LAYERED image that already exists
@LayerName must not be the name of an existing layer from the given layered image
@LayerToCopy must be the name of a layer from the same layered image that already exists
